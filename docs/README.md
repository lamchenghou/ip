# Dot's User Guide

## Unique Features

### Adding of 3 types of Tasksâ€“Todo, Event and Deadline

A [todo](#creating-a-todo-todo) is a simple task with a description, you can use
a [deadline](#creating-a-deadline-deadline) task if you prefer setting a deadline. \
You can specify an [event](#creating-an-event-event) with start and end date!

### Auto-datetime

When adding [deadlines](#creating-a-deadline-deadline) or [events](#creating-an-event-event),
you can choose to use the auto datetime formatter. Instead of `deadline_desc`, `start`, or
`end`, write a datetime in the following format: `dd/MM/YYYY hhmm` e.g. `17/09/2023 2300`.

It will be translated to `Sep 17 2023 11PM`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not the same format as the `whatsgoingon dd/MM/yyyy` command.

### Undo commands that changes tasks

You are able to undo the latest command if they are one of the following:

- `todo`, `deadline`, `event`
- `mark`, `unmark`
- `delete`

An undo cannot be undone, and an undo cannot be performed twice.

> [!NOTE] Notes about the usage formats
> - Words surrounded by angle brackets `<` and `>` represent placeholders, which you can input a value into. Some
    > placeholders are specified like `<deadline_desc:dd/MM/yyyy hhmm>` which means you can use [this datetime format]
    > (#auto-datetime).
> - It is not compulsory to specify in the required datetime format, you can input any other text
    > if you like.
> - Some placeholders are specified like `<index_number>` which indicates that a task's index number
    > is expected.

A task is defined as either a `todo`, `event`, or `deadline`.
